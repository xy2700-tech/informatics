        <p>Mapping access and funding flow to non-profit arts and cultural organizations across New York City boroughs.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            New York City is known internationally for its artistic and cultural vibrancy, as residents and tourists alike frequent venues from city-owned museums to private galleries. 
            This project specifically focuses on the neighborhood level arts and culture ecosystem, 
            highlighting the spatial distribution of non-profit arts and culture organizations. 
            Many of the these organization's programming is made affordable from grants such as NYC Department of Cultural Affaris's Cultural Development Fund, awarded annually. 
            Data is pulled from the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs directory of cultural organizations, organized by discipline, and geocoded for visual clarity. 
            A webscraper appended website links to the organization dataframe, which is then merged with neighborhood tabulation areas.

            <li><strong>Manhattan Concentration:</strong> 57% of all arts & cultural non-profits are located in Manhattan</li>
            <li><strong>Gallery Districts:</strong> Chelsea and Williamsburg show the highest density of visual arts organizations</li>
            <li><strong>Theater Hub:</strong> Over 200 performance venues concentrate in Midtown and Lower Manhattan</li>

            Manhattan alone is home to more than a thousand organizations, more than the other four boroughs combined. 
            The access gap is striking when considering density, as visualized below. 
            While an average Manhattan neighborhood might have seven organizations, a resident in Bronx, Queens, or Staten Island may only find less than three in their neighborhood.

        44% of Bronx's neighborhoods do not house any arts & culture non-profits, that's almost half of the borough! 
    </p>
    </section>

      <section>
          <p> Hover over to see the total funding awarded to each borough and discipline in fiscal year 2024. 
          Theater is the most well funded  discipline among New York City's arts and cultural non-profits, totalling 6.7 million, followed by music and dance. 
        Yet no theater or dance non-profit in Bronx received funding.
          </p>

                  Non-profits, in additions to public institutions, are vital in cultivating creative communities on a local scale. They are often a great resource of affordable arts education and safe public dialogue.
        The city can invest in the long term well-being of residents in underserved neighborhoods by proviidng robust funding to small arts and culture non-profits.
